  \textbf{Introduction}
  
  This set of notes is transcribed from UBC's MATH 320/321 (Real Variables I/II) sequence. The course covers the first 9 chapters of Rudin's "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" with occasional omissions \& additions. The numbering of the definitions/theorems/examples will follow that used in Rudin to make following along with the textbook convenient. The structure of these notes is such that it is split into the main text (the boxed elements) and side text (everything else). It is possible to read just the main text for the main ideas without loss of continuity, but the additional discussion of the side text may be useful.
