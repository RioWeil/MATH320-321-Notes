\section{Basic Topology}
\subsection{Finite and Countable Sets}
This chapter is split into two portions; the first looks at counting, what it means for us to say that two sets have the same number of elements, and concludes with a classic theorem of Cantor concerning uncountable sets. The second part looks at abstract topological properties of sets, before moving onto the topology of the real numbers. 

Let us then begin with our discussion of counting.
